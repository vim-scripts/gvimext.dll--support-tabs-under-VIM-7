Notes for opening files under tabs in VIM using the gvimext.dll right-click context menu:
-.  UseTab.reg
This file will add the following registry value:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Vim\Gvim]
"UseTab"="1"
The above value will make the "Edit with ... using tabs" context menu as the defaul menu.
To import this reg file, right-click it and choose Merge in Windows Explorer.
-.  Shift key effect
Shift key serves as a toggle key for the "Edit with ... using tabs" context menu.  If you hold down the Shift key and then right-click the selectec files in Windows Explorer, the opposite of the default Vim context menu will display.
Once the Vim content menu displays, you don't need to hold down the Shift key anymore.  Its effect will hold even until the next Right-Click.

Coding notes:
-.  The code changes have been compiled under Visual Studio 6 using nmake.  It has not been compiled under BC5, VS 2003, etc.  Please try these other compilers as need arises.
-.  I used a 3rd party SendKeys class from lallous <lallousx86@yahoo.com> (http://www.codeproject.com/cpp/sendkeys_cpp_Article.asp).  Original Delphi code copyright holder is Ken Henderson <khen@compuserve.com>. The SendKeys.cpp file has been modified to allow error-free compilation under VS6.  Credit should go to the above mentioned coders.
-.  I have changed Makefile for the inclusion of SendKeys class.  I do not have the expertise to change Make_bc5.mak and Make_ming.mak.  Please update these two files as need arises.
-.  Localization: because of the new "... using tabs" verbiage, the localization resource file should include the translations for these new verbiages.  Again, I do not have the expertise to do this.  Please update the resource files as need arises.
-.  Changed files for this code update are:
gvimext.cpp
gvimext.h
Makefile
-.  New files for this code update are:
UseTab.txt: this document
UseTab.reg: registry file to import the UseTab registry value
SendKeys.cpp: modified 3rd party class from http://www.codeproject.com/cpp/sendkeys_cpp_Article.asp
SendKeys.h: 3rd party class from http://www.codeproject.com/cpp/sendkeys_cpp_Article.asp
-.  Testing: this code change has been tested on English Windows 2000 Pro ONLY due to my limited resources.  Please test it on other Windows OSs.
